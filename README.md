## Description

> [!WARNING]
> This implementation may not be secure. Use it only for educational purposes.

This is a simple implementation of client-server communication using the ratcheted exchange protocol. Both the client and the server are implemented in pure Rust.

The server simply sends a message from one client to another. The server does not know the content of the message. The server only knows the ID of the sender and the receiver.

Clients are using the ratcheted exchange protocol to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Usage

To run the server, use the following command in [`server`](server/) directory:

```bash
cargo run
```

> [!NOTE]
> The server must be running before the client.

To run the client, use the following command in [`client`](client/) directory:

```bash
cargo run
```

> [!NOTE]
> Second client must be launched ONLY after the first client was initialized with the server.
